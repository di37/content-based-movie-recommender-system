# Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

The Content-Based Movie Recommender System is designed to suggest movies to users by analyzing the similarities between movies. Unlike collaborative filtering that relies on user behavior, this system focuses on the inherent characteristics of the movies, including genre, director, cast, plot descriptions, and other metadata. Our goal is to provide personalized movie recommendations that closely align with the user's preferences and interests.

# Features

**Movie Similarity Identification:** Utilizes various movie attributes to compute similarity scores between movies.
**Rich Metadata Utilization:** Incorporates a wide range of movie metadata, including genres, directors, actors, and plot summaries, to enhance recommendation accuracy.

# Running the Code

Still need to turn it into a web app. For now, check out the notebook in the `research` folder - `01_Development.ipynb` notebook.
